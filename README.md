### Getting Started 🚀

Before using any of these tools, keep the following in mind:

* **Backups:** Create a system restore point or backup your entire system before making any significant changes. This allows you to revert to a previous state if something goes wrong.
* **Research:** Understand what each tool does *before* running it. Read the documentation or check online forums for user experiences.
* **Moderation:** Don't blindly apply every tweak or setting available. Consider what features you actually need and disable only those you don't use.
